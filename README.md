# ðŸ¤–FOSSBot

A bot for managing FOSS GECT's Discord server, and for carrying out tasks that we are too lazy to do on our own. ðŸ˜œ

## Interacting with FOSSBot

### How can I interact with the bot?  

You can interact with the bot by typing in supported bot commands as messages in the server. Bot commands have to be prefixed with the **bot command prefix** for the bot to recognize it as a command. The ampersand symbol (**&**) is the prefix currently in use.  
As of now, the bot only responds to messages sent in a specific channel, set aside specifically for bot interactions. This behavior maybe changed in the future.

### What commands can I use?  

The `help` command can be used to list all commands currently supported by the bot:

```js
&help
```

The `help` command can also be used to understand the usage or purpose of individual commands. For example, here we use the `help` command to see its own description and usage:

```js
&help help

// Usage: &help [command-name]
```
